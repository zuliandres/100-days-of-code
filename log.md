# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 25, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Setup my environment with github ssh, vscode, homebrew, and copilot AI. Signed up for JS algorithms and data structures and did 25 steps. This is a good way to start on a habit and not think too much about the work

**Thoughts**: Super easy and borin tutorial, but this also helps me get started with some recap and also building on JS (algs/DS) which never where my strong suits.
