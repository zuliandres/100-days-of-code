You have a strong foundation in both music and engineering, making you well-positioned to transition into audio/music technology. Here are some key areas to explore, along with resources and open-source projects to help you build skills and showcase your work:

Key Areas to Focus On
	1.	Digital Signal Processing (DSP) for Audio
	•	Understanding FFT, filters, reverb, and synthesis.
	•	Learning libraries like JUCE, pyo, and SuperCollider.
	2.	Audio Plugin and Software Development
	•	Developing VST/AU plugins using JUCE or iPlug2.
	•	Exploring Pure Data (Pd) and Max/MSP for interactive music applications.
	3.	Machine Learning for Audio
	•	Applying ML to music with Magenta and DDSP.
	•	Understanding deep learning models for music generation and audio classification.
	4.	Spatial and Interactive Audio
	•	Binaural and 3D audio using Resonance Audio.
	•	Web-based audio with Web Audio API.
	5.	Embedded Audio and Sound Synthesis
	•	Exploring real-time audio with Bela or ESP32 Audio.
	•	Building custom synthesizers with Axoloti.
